**PHASE 1:**

We need to, on hover, give number of dev days, worst case complete date, projected complete date
on hover for each epic. 

When we override the dev days under each date, we need to be able to save those as queryParams.
When you change the points per day on the sidebar, individual day's adjusted capacity should reset automatically.

We need to add the current asignee's profile photo to the left of the ticket.

We need to diminish the brightness of a column if the day has already past (using CSS)

We need all the blocked by tickets listed when you hover on another ticket
