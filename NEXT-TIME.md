**PHASE 1:**

We need to, on hover, give number of dev days, worst case complete date, projected complete date
on hover for each epic. 

When we override the dev days under each date, we need to be able to save those as queryParams.
When you change the points per day on the sidebar, individual day's adjusted capacity should reset automatically.

We need to add the current asignee's profile photo to the left of the ticket.

When you hover on a ticket you should be able to see all tickets that block it
